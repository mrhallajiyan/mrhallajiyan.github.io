<b> About </b>
<p align="justify"> Iâ€™m a graduate research and teaching assistant at the University of British Columbia and a member of Dependable Systems Lab. My research interests lie in the area of Secure Cyber-physical and Networked Systems, the Internet of Things, and Machine Learning.</p>

<p align="justify"> Currently, I'm conducting research on "Robust and Resilient Machine Learning for Connected Healthcare Device Systems" in which we aim to address the security issues for using ML in healthcare domain. </p>

<p align="justify"> I earned both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) in Tehran, Iran. My Master's thesis, completed under the supervision of Professor Ali Doustmohammadi, focuses on "False Data Injection Detection on Measurement Units of Smart Grid Systems Using Petri Nets." In this work, I developed a Petri Net-based model for the protection section of the smart grid, which can simulate the simultaneous occurrence of error and attack. In addition, I applied a method based on the theory of finite fields and provided a parity check solution to detect false data injection attacks on measurement units in smart grid systems. </p>
